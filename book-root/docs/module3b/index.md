# Module 3b: The Robot Cognitive Intelligence Layer

While Module 3 focused on the foundational "brain" for perception and navigation, this section explores a higher level of intelligence: the cognitive layer. This is where the robot moves beyond simply executing commands and begins to exhibit more autonomous, goal-directed behavior.

## What you will learn

- The distinction between a basic navigation stack and a higher-level cognitive intelligence layer.
- The role of concepts like world modeling and behavior trees.
- How a robot can adapt to unfamiliar environments.
