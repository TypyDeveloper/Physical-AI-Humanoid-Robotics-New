# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." In this module, we delve into the world of digital twins, exploring how virtual environments can be used to simulate, test, and interact with robotic systems. We will focus on two powerful platforms: Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction.

## What you will learn

- The fundamental concepts of physics, gravity, and collision simulation in Gazebo.
- How to create high-fidelity renderings and implement human-robot interaction (HRI) using Unity.
- The principles and implementation of sensor simulation for LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs.

Let's build robust and intelligent robotic systems in a virtual space!
