# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." In this module, we will explore ROS 2, the open-source robot operating system that acts as the nervous system for many modern robotic platforms. Understanding ROS 2 is crucial for developing intelligent robots that interact with the real world.

## What you will learn

- The fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, and services.
- How to bridge Python-based AI agents to ROS controllers using `rclpy`.
- How to use URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) to describe humanoid robots.

Let's dive in and build a strong foundation for your journey into physical AI and humanoid robotics!
