# Design and Content Decisions for Module 4

## Document Structure Decisions

*   **Modular Approach**: Each major concept (VLA, Whisper-to-Action, Cognitive Planning, Capstone) has its own Markdown file to improve readability and navigability.
*   **Hierarchical Organization**: Content is organized with clear headings and subheadings to facilitate understanding of complex topics.
*   **Introduction and Objectives**: Each module/major section begins with an introduction and clear learning objectives to set expectations for the reader.

## Content Decisions

*   **Focus on Conceptual Understanding**: Emphasis is placed on explaining *why* certain architectures or approaches are used, alongside *how* they function.
*   **Use of Examples/Scenarios**: Real-world or relatable scenarios (e.g., household robot command for capstone) are used to illustrate complex concepts and make them tangible.
*   **APA Citation Requirement**: To promote academic rigor and proper attribution of sources.

## Docusaurus Specific Decisions

*   **Category Files (`_category_.json`)**: Used to define sidebar labels and ordering, ensuring a logical flow through the module content.
*   **Markdown for Content**: Leveraging Docusaurus's excellent Markdown support for easy content creation and formatting.
*   **Theme Selection**: (Conceptual) The default Docusaurus theme is assumed, with potential for customization for branding or improved UX.

## Navigation Choices

*   **Sidebar Navigation**: Primary navigation through the Docusaurus sidebar, reflecting the module and section hierarchy.
*   **Internal Links**: Extensive use of internal links within and between documents to connect related concepts.

## Plugin Considerations (Conceptual)

*   **Search Plugin**: Integration of a search functionality for easy access to information within the book.
*   **Diagramming Plugin**: (Future Consideration) A plugin to embed or generate diagrams directly from text (e.g., Mermaid.js) would enhance visual explanations.

## Unresolved/Future Decisions

*   Specific Docusaurus theme customizations.
*   Choice of diagramming tool/plugin.
*   Detailed review process for content accuracy.
