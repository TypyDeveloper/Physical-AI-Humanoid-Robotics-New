Create:

Architecture sketch (voice-to-action pipeline, ROS 2 planning flow, perception → manipulation loop)

Section structure

Research approach

Quality-validation plan

Decisions needing documentation:

Whisper vs. alternative ASR options

LLM planning methods for ROS 2 (pipeline, constraints, safety)

Vision model selection for object identification

Manipulation strategy tradeoffs in simulation

Testing strategy:

Validate voice-command recognition

Check plan correctness against acceptance criteria

Verify navigation, obstacle avoidance, and object-manipulation success

Technical details:

Use research-concurrent workflow

Follow APA citation rules from Constitution

Organize by phases: Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis
