Breakdown the plan into specific executable tasks as a checklist.Include:

2.Chapter Development task (for module 1 with 3 lessons)

## Response snapshot

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed task breakdown for Module 2, including Docusaurus setup and content development tasks for each user story.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/002-digital-twin/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with the implementation of Module 2.
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual PHR creation from template.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure the `create-phr.sh` script is available and correctly executable, or improve manual PHR creation workflow.
